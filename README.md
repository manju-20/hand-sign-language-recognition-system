# Hand Sign Language Recognition system:
Developed real-time project using Python where the convolution neural networks which recognizes the various hand signs by capturing video and getting exact text letters by comparing with the trained model. 
The aim of this project to create a system that is capable of identifying American Sign Language, which helps the speech impaired people to enhance the communication among others.
# Libraries used : OpenCV, numpy, MediaPipe and TensorFlow.
